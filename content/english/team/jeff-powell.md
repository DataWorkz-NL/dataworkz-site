* **Passports**: The two passports because although I live and work in the Netherlands, I remain a part American.  
* **Granite**: The piece of granite, from the Sierra Nevada in California, reminds me of my home in the US and the pleasures of hiking and camping with friends and family through the mountains.  
* **Diploma**: Education continues to play an import role in my life.
* **Book**: Adam Smith's, "The Theory of Moral Sentiments", represents my interests in both ethics and economics.  
* **Shoes**: In addition, I try to find a balance between body and brain as symbolized by running sports shoes and goggles.  
* **Rings**: The wedding rings and birth cards, of course, represent the most important aspects of my current life.
