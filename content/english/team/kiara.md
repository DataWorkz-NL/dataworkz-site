* **Pikachu plushie:** I grew up as a Pokémon fan, and still kept the plushie to this day.
* **Nintendo Switch:** For brushing up on my Japanese, of course. I recently found this was a nice way to get started on Spanish too!
* **Headphones**: I always liked music not just for listening but for singing as well, leading me to e.g. symphonic metal. Can’t wait to be able to go to festivals again!
* **Nyx lipstick:** While I might not find the time for this every day, I nevertheless found makeup to be really fun.
* **Trans flag**: Since my coming-out I made a bunch of cool friends in the trans and queer communities. :)
* **Mac laptop:** Work aside, I’ve been playing with code on my spare time as well.
* **Beaded necklace:** I’d felt an interest in fashion from what I’d seen in visual kei bands, and recently started applying these lessons myself as well!
